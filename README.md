# CryptoClustering

## Overview
CryptoClustering is a data analysis project focused on clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price changes. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover hidden patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies together. This helps investors and analysts understand market trends and make informed investment decisions.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Retrieve cryptocurrency price data from crypto_market_data.csv.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data for further analysis.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to identify key features that influence price changes.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to categorize cryptocurrencies based on their performance.
- **Optimization**: Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for both original scaled and PCA data.
- **Visualization**: Visualize clusters using various plotting libraries to provide insightful graphical representations.
